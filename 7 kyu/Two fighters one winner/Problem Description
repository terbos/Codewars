Create a function that returns the name of the winner in a fight between two fighters.

Each fighter takes turns attacking the other and whoever kills the other first is victorious. Death is defined as having health <= 0.

Each fighter will be a Fighter object/instance. See the Fighter class below in your chosen language.

Both health and damagePerAttack (damage_per_attack for python) will be integers larger than 0. You can mutate the Fighter objects.

Example:
class Fighter
{
private:
    std::string name;

    int health;

    int damagePerAttack;

public:
    Fighter(std::string name, int health, int damagePerAttack)
    {
        this->name = name;
        this->health = health;
        this->damagePerAttack = damagePerAttack;
    }

    ~Fighter() { };

    std::string getName()
    {
        return name;
    }

    int getHealth()
    {
        return health;
    }

    int getDamagePerAttack()
    {
        return damagePerAttack;
    }

    void setHealth(int value)
    {
        health = value;
    }
};
